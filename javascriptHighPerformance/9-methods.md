# All Functions are Methods
In JavaScript all functions are object methods.
If a function is not a method of a JavaScript object, it is a function of the global object

# To determine which object this refers to; use the following precedence of order.

Precedence	Object
1	        bind()
2	        apply() and call()
3	        Object method
4	        Global scope
