# higher-order functions 
JavaScript has some of these functions already built in

1. `.forEach()`
This iterates over every element in an array with the same code, but does not change or mutate the array, and it returns undefined.
2. `.map()`
This method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements, and then building a new array from the returned values.
3. `.reduce()`
This method executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left to right).
4. `.filter()`
This checks every single element in an array to see whether it meets certain criteria as specified in the filter method, and then it returns a new array with the elements that match the criteria.
